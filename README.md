# DESIGN-AND-IMPLEMENTATION-OF-WOMEN-SAFETY-SYSTEM-BASED-ON-IOT-TECHNOLOGIES
 In Today’s World, the safety of women is in danger especially in India. The rate of crimes against women is not decreasing but in fact increasing at an alarming rate especially harassment ,molestation, eve teasing, rape, kidnapping and domestic violence .Some of the rape cases are very gruesome and brutal like the Nirbhaya Case in Delhi. Many preventive measures have been taken by the government to stop these misbehaving activities but still has not affected the growing rate of these crimes and has remained unaffected. So it is primitive to provide an application which helps the women to tackle this problem rapidly and efficiently.  The user can be constantly tracked by the user’s emergency contacts. When the user encounters any misbehaving activity, the user can press the SOS button which uses GPS and GSM system to get the accurate location coordinates and send SMS to the emergency contacts. The IoT module is used to tracking in real time ,and the location is continuously updated into the webpage.
